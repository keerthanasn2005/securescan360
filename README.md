## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Gemini API Key:**
    1.  Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to get a free API key.
    2.  You will need to add this key to the frontend `index.html` file.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/sitesecure360.git](https://github.com/your-username/sitesecure360.git)
    cd sitesecure360
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Install the necessary npm packages:
        ```bash
        npm install express cors lighthouse chrome-launcher
        ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    * Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your code editor.
    * Find the `generateAIReport` function and the `handleAssistantChat` function.
    * In both functions, locate the line `const apiKey = "";` and paste your Gemini API key between the quotes.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * In your terminal, make sure you are in the `backend` directory.
    * Run the following command:
        ```bash
        node server.js
        ```
    * The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Application:**
    * Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your web browser.
    * It is **highly recommended** to use a live server extension (like "Live Server" in VS Code) to avoid any browser security issues.
